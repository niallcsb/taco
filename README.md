Just testing out new HTML, CSS, and JS tricks. Probably going to look into more advanced things and other languages as well.

Pretty basic for now. It's only the home page and I'm just working on getting it perfect I guess before I start doing other pages.

Needs to be opened in a live environment so that the JS generated reviews will populate properly
